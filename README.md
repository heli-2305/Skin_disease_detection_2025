🩺 Skin Disease Detection 2025
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for the classification of various skin conditions using pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically EfficientNetB0, along with a custom classifier for feature extraction. The primary goal is to assist dermatologists and healthcare professionals by providing an AI-driven, efficient diagnostic tool for identifying skin diseases. 🤖
